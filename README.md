# Pathfinders

## Introduction

"Oh, am I supposed to talk?

Hi friends!

I'm Pathfinder, and I'm here to save the day...maybe.

Sometimes luck is involved, but my accuracy is  getting better every day. My creators are mechatronics students after all and they're ready and excited for this challenge, as am I!

Anirudh gave me sight using computer vision algorithms, Nishanth gave me spatial awareness and Raj gave me limbs to move . Now I'm a mobile , talking, health care machine. 

Powered up and ready to go. I think we're going to do great, friend!"
